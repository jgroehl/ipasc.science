    paragraph = "On behalf of the International Photoacoustic Standardisation Consortium (IPASC), we propose a standardized minimal set of metadata parameters and a standardized data format for photoacoustic imaging. Specifically, we recommend a standard HDF5 structure for raw time series data and metadata and the extension of the DICOM standard to support photoacoustic images in clinical applications. An international data standard for photoacoustics will be a first important step towards accelerated research by facilitating inter-group data exchange and inter-device comparability, and will thus form a foundation to integrate basic research with clinical translation of PAI."

Our aim is to provide a platform that enables reserach groups and companies from all over the world to test their developed photoacoustic imaging modalities."
