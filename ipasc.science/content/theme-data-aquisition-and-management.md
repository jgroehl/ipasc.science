## Mission:

Our overarching goal is to enable intercomparison of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data between different users (scientific groups / industries). To achieve this goal the Data Acquisition and Management (DAM) theme is conducting work towards three main goals:

</center>

Goal 1 is to define an essential list of metadata to fully characterise the format of PAI data acquired from commercial and custom-built PAI instruments and to transfer the device-specific data of instruments within the consortium in an open access database. Goal 2 is to implement an open source tool that enables conversion to the prior agreed standardized data format (HDF5). Goal 3 is to provide a platform that enables open access of PA reference data that can be used for comparison of processing algorithms etc.


## Progress:

We have created a table in which we collect information on the technical specifications of all PAI systems that are used within the consortium. We have made three main recommendations: (1) To initially only include raw time series data into the standardization, (2) To use HDF5 as the standardized file format, and (3) To create a standardized list of metadata parameters. Furthermore, the working group has formulated a plan to create an open source conversion tool between data formats.

## Proposed deliverables:

<div class="listing">
<h3>Towards goal 1:</h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><em><b>Consensus document:</b></em> This document aims to define a comprehensive list of necessary parameters to fully characterise PAI data. The document should contain IPASC consensus on:</p></li>
	<p class="sublisting">
		(1) Definitions of the required terminology.<br />
		(2) A detailled description of the metadata parameters identified as being essential to characterize PA devices. <br />
		(3) Definition of the physical units and data format that the respective parameters are stored in.
	</p>
	<li><p><em><b>Strategy document:</b></em> This document aims to describe the steps necessary to set up a PA device database. It should contain IPASC consensus on:</p></li>
	<p class="sublisting">
		(1) The device data collection strategy. <br />
		(2) A device data storage strategy (containing e.g. the database format). <br />
		(3) A means (e.g. a software tool) to transfer the technical information of the PAI devices to the created database.
	</p>
</ol>

<h3>Towards goal 2:</h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><em><b>A software tool:</b></em> This software tool should be able to provide conversion functionality from multiple different proprietary formats to the agreed HDF5 format with all metadata. This entails:</p></li>
	<p class="sublisting">
		(1) A <em>requirement analysis:</em> Collection of all the requirements for the tool. <br />
		(2) Setup of a <em>code repository:</em> A repository that contains the implementation of the converters.
	</p>
</ol>
</div>
 
<div class="listing">
<h3> Towards goal 3:</h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><em><b>Strategy document:</b></em> Discussion of a strategy how to create an open access data repository for the reference datasets.</p></li>
	<p class="sublisting">
		(1) The ideal composition of a reference data set for comparison of processing algorithms. <br />
		(2) A hosting strategy (single data items; data sets; Application programming interface (API) access) <br />
		(3) A reporting strategy (referencing of raw datasets after processing; computed metrics)
